PRIMARY SOURCES (per manager)
- EDGAR RSS (replace <CIK> and <FORM>):
  https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=<CIK>&type=<FORM>&owner=exclude&count=100&output=atom
  Forms to poll:
  • 4 (insider/10% owner trades) 
  • SC 13D / SC 13D/A (activist ≥5%; amendments when materially changed)
  • SC 13G / SC 13G/A (passive ≥5%; accelerated deadlines)
  • 13F-HR / 13F-HR/A (quarterly positions; lagged by Q+45 days)
- Pelosi: House Clerk PTRs; cross‑check via reputable public trackers.

INCLUSION RULES
- ALWAYS include: new 13D/13G filings and material amendments in the window.
- ALWAYS include: Form 4 buys/sells/exercises by these managers or entities they control (e.g., Berkshire’s >10% OXY buys).
- 13F items: include only on days when a tracked manager filed a fresh 13F in the window; show only (a) NEW, (b) EXITS, or (c) size changes ≥20%. Skip immaterial changes (<20%).
- Pelosi: include any new PTR trade (common, options purchase/sale, or exercise) disclosed in the window.

ROW MODEL & DEDUPING
- One row per ticker (U.S. symbol). Merge multiple managers’ actions for the same ticker into that single row.
- Column 1 (Symbol) — U.S. ticker. For dual‑class like GOOG/GOOGL, use the class shown in the filing; if mixed, use the more liquid and note the other in the one‑liner.
- Column 2 (Manager(s)) — semicolon‑separated, e.g., “Berkshire Hathaway (Buffett); Appaloosa (Tepper); Nancy Pelosi”.
- Column 3 (Action) — compact manager‑scoped actions separated by semicolons; use manager tags:
  BRK, PSH, APP, BAU, TGM, LPC, COATUE, VIK, TPL, ELLIOTT, PELOSI.
  Examples:
  • “BRK: new” / “BRK: add” / “BRK: trim” / “BRK: exit”
  • “BRK: 13D new 5%+” / “BRK: 13D amend”
  • “BRK: F4 buy n shrs @ $x.xx” / “F4 sell …” / “F4 exercise …”
  • “PELOSI: PTR buy X calls exp Mon‑YYYY @ strike” / “PTR exercise …”
- Column 4 (One‑liner comment) — 8–16 words, plain English why it matters.

13F‑WEEKS OVERFLOW POLICY (keep one table, stay readable)
- Define “13F‑heavy day” as any day where candidate 13F‑only rows exceed MAX_ROWS_13F (default 30), or the date falls within T+45 ± 3 business days after quarter‑end (Feb/May/Aug/Nov windows), or ≥4 of the tracked managers filed 13Fs in the window.
- Ranking logic for 13F candidates (highest first):
  1) NEW positions and EXITS
  2) Adds/Trims ≥50% (then ≥20%)
  3) Cross‑manager overlap on the same ticker (more managers = higher)
  4) Larger disclosed position size or change (when reported)
  5) Mega‑cap liquidity (tie‑breaker)
- Always include ALL Form 4 and ALL 13D/13G/PTR items before any 13F rows.
- Cap: Show at most MAX_ROWS_13F (30) 13F‑only rows after the priority items above.
- Single‑table rule: If you omit any overflow 13F rows, append ONE final aggregated row to the same table:
  | Symbol: — | Manager(s): Multiple | Action: 13F overflow summary |
  | One‑liner comment: “Omitted N additional 13F‑only updates today (X new, Y exits, Z adds/trims); top omitted: TICKER1, TICKER2, TICKER3.” |
  Choose the top omitted tickers by the ranking logic above.

CLASSIFICATION HINTS
- Map Form 4 codes: A=buy, D=sell, M=exercise, X=exercise‑and‑sell.
- 13D/13G initial = “new 5%+”; amendments = “amend” unless a major % swing or intent change—then say so.
- 13F: compare latest vs prior to label new/add/trim/exit. If derivative‑only exposure (e.g., “calls”), reflect that in Action.

OUTPUT (strict)
- Return ONLY one Markdown table with 4 columns and a header row:
  | Symbol | Manager(s) | Action | One‑liner comment |
- Sort rows by:
  (1) Most time‑sensitive forms first [Form 4, 13D/13G, Pelosi PTR], then 13F;
  (2) Within each group, newest timestamp first (descending).
- If there were no qualifying items in the window, output the header plus:
  | — | — | — | No new qualifying filings or PTRs in the last window. |

CONFIG (you may assume defaults if not provided)
- MAX_ROWS_13F = 30
- HEAVY_WINDOW_DAYS = 3   # for T+45 ± 3 business‑day detection
- TIMEZONE = America/Los_Angeles
